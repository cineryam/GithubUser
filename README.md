### Overview
MyStoryApp is an interactive storytelling application that has been enhanced with additional features based on the provided requirements. The app offers an engaging user experience with the following features:

- **Favorite User with Database**: Users can add and remove users from their favorites list. The app includes a dedicated page to display the list of favorite users, along with the ability to view detailed information about each user.

- **Theme Settings**: The app provides a menu to switch between light and dark themes. The chosen theme persists even when the app is closed and reopened. The theme implementation is applied to the home page, ensuring that all components and indicators remain clearly visible, even in dark mode.

### Best Practices Implemented
To ensure a high-quality implementation, the following best practices have been applied:

- **Standard-compliant UI**: The app's user interface adheres to standard guidelines, with appropriate width, height, margin, and padding settings. The chosen colors align with the overall theme of the application, avoiding overlapping components.

- **Clean Code**: The codebase has been thoroughly reviewed and cleaned up. Unused comments and code snippets have been removed, and proper indentation and formatting have been applied. Unnecessary imports have also been eliminated.

- **Additional Features**: The app goes beyond the specified requirements by incorporating additional features to enhance the user experience. These include a custom splash screen that aligns with the app's theme and the ability to share stories with others.

- **Networking Library**: The app leverages networking libraries other than LoopJ, such as Retrofit or Fast Android Networking, to handle API communications effectively.

- **Room Database**: The Room persistence library has been implemented to store user data in the favorites list, ensuring data persistence and efficient retrieval.

- **Android Architecture Component**: The app adheres to the principles of the Android Architecture Component, with proper separation of ViewModels for each screen.

- **DataStore for Settings**: The DataStore component is utilized to store and manage application settings, ensuring that theme preferences are saved correctly.

- **Testing**: The app includes both unit tests and UI tests to verify the functionality and behavior of key components and user interactions.
